# LOTL Detector - Tier 1 Blocklist
# 
# These binaries are blocked at the kernel level (instant blocking).
# Blocking is based on both path AND inode to prevent copy-based evasion.
#
# WARNING: Adding binaries here will break legitimate use!
# Only add binaries that have NO legitimate use on this system.
